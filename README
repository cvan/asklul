Ask Lul
v1.0

Ask Lul is a simple and fun way to schwanicate your schwanication. You can ask
Lul just about anything (or program him to answer just about anything), and
his responses are tailored to keywords that you specify.

The responses in the code are inside jokes from my AP Calc class. The racier
and profane ones have been stripped out for the sake of keeping Github innocent
and protecting the folks in the class.
